* React Router
* Lucide Icons

---

## 🏗️ Features Implemented

* Production-grade folder structure
* Routing setup
* Home page (landing UI)
* Login page
* Register page
* Google login UI (frontend only)

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

```

```

---

## 🌐 Pages

### ➤ Home Page

* Hero section
* Features section
* Navigation bar

---

### ➤ Login Page

* Email/password login form
* Google login button (UI only)

---

### ➤ Register Page

* User registration form

---

## 🚀 Navigation

```
/           → Home
/login      → Login Page
/register   → Register Page
```

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* Google authentication not implemented yet
* Backend API integration not connected yet

---

## ✅ Result

* Clean UI setup
* Responsive layout
* Production-ready structure

---


# 🔗 Frontend-Backend Integration & Authentication (Phase 2)

---

## 📌 Overview

This phase connects the frontend with backend APIs and implements authentication using JWT and Google OAuth.

---

## 🔑 Features Implemented

* API integration using Axios
* Redux-based authentication state
* Login & Register API integration
* JWT token storage (localStorage)
* Protected routes
* Google login integration (OAuth)

---

## 🌐 API Integration

All API calls are handled using a centralized Axios instance with automatic token injection.

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User logs in
2. Backend returns JWT token
3. Token stored in localStorage
4. Token attached to all API requests
5. Protected routes verified

---

## 🔒 Protected Routes

Users must be authenticated to access protected pages like dashboard.

---

## 🔑 Google OAuth

* Implemented using Google Cloud Platform
* Redirect-based login flow
* Backend handles authentication
* Frontend receives authenticated session

---

## ✅ Result

* Frontend fully connected to backend
* Authentication system working
* Google login enabled
* Secure route protection

---

# 🔐 Google OAuth Authentication

---

## 📌 Overview

This feature enables users to log in using their Google account.

---

## 🔑 Flow

1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Redirected to Google login
3. Google returns user profile
4. Backend:

   * Finds or creates user
   * Generates JWT token
5. Redirects to frontend with token

---

## 🌐 Endpoints

```
GET /api/v1/auth/google
GET /api/v1/auth/google/callback
```

---

## Token Handling

* JWT generated after login
* Sent to frontend via redirect URL
* Stored in localStorage

---

## Result

* Google login fully working
* User auto-created if not exists
* JWT authentication integrated

---

# 📄 Document Upload, Paste-Text & Analysis Result Wiring (Phase 3)

---

## 📌 Overview

The Dashboard's upload → AI analysis → result-display pipeline was effectively dead: `Dashboard.tsx` had the call to `POST /analysis/run` commented out, and the document-click handler referenced a `setSelectedDoc` function whose declaration was also commented out (a `ReferenceError` waiting to happen). So documents could be uploaded, but the AI summary/risk result was never fetched or shown, and pasting text under the backend's 50-character minimum surfaced as an opaque `alert("Upload failed ❌")` with no real detail.

---

## 🔑 Fixes

* **`Dashboard.tsx`** — rebuilt the wiring: `runAnalysis(documentId)` now actually calls `POST /analysis/run` and sets the result; `handleUploaded(documentId)` (passed to `UploadPanel`) refreshes the document list and immediately runs analysis on the new document. Fixed the dangling `setSelectedDoc` reference.
* **`UploadPanel.tsx`** — now reports the real backend error message via `react-hot-toast` (`err.response.data.message`) instead of a generic `alert()`; client-side guards prevent submitting an empty file / under-50-char text before hitting the API; disables itself while an analysis is in flight so a second upload can't be started mid-analysis.
* **`ResultPanel.tsx`** — added an `analyzing` loading state ("Analyzing document with AI…") so there's visible feedback while the OpenAI call is in flight, instead of the panel just sitting blank.
* **`DocumentList.tsx`** — was still reading `doc.file_path` / `doc.created_at` (snake_case) from a raw-SQL-era API response; the backend now returns Prisma's camelCase (`filePath` / `createdAt`) after the ORM migration (see `server/README.md` Phase 5), so this was silently broken. Fixed field names, and added a `refreshKey` prop so the list refetches after a new upload instead of only on mount.

---

## ✅ Result

Verified in a real headless-browser session (Playwright, driven end-to-end — login, paste text, wait for the loading state, wait for the populated result, click an existing document to re-trigger analysis):

* Pasting a sample legal clause renders a real AI-generated Summary, Risk Level badge (Low/Medium/High), Important Clauses list, and Risk Insights list
* The "Analyzing document with AI…" loading state shows correctly between submit and result
* Clicking a previously-analyzed document in "Your Documents" re-runs and re-displays its analysis
* Zero console errors across the full flow
